Dynamic content loading.
Form validation.

## Project Progress:

We started created our project by setting up the basic HTML structure for the website. We created placeholder content for each section (About, Skills, Projects, Contact). After setting up the basic structure we begin defining the color scheme and typography for the website and styled the header, navigation menu, and individual sections using css. After styling our project, we begin with adding interactivity with javacript. We implemented smooth scrolling for navigation links and added form validation for the contact form. The challenges we faced were structuring the HTML to ensure a logical flow and ease of navigation, Managing different sections and ensuring consistency across the website, making website more user interactive and fixing the responsive issues of the websites. To solve the issues we added comments, HTML tags for better organization. We used different css classes and variables for maintaing a consistent color scheme. We regularly updated content to reflect new projects and skills and monitored website performance and fixed any emerging issues. We tested our website to ensure that the website is responsive and looks good on various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
